# ATP

This document will outline the flow of the ATP demo.

Gene covers that the user of the Notebook needs to run the following steps:

- Setup
    + JDBC Setup
        * `[completed]`
    + Timeline Code
        * `[unnecessary - according to Gene]`
    + Create Schema && Create Tables && Load Transfer Order Data
        * `[completed]`
- Run
    + ATP on Date && Inventory on Date
        * "To see how these differ..."
    + Multi-Line ATP - Quick Promise
        * "To see how a single ATP date is computed for multiple lines"
    + Use "Add" to enter each item.
        * I don't really know what he means by that...
